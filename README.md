Look at Washington Post Twitter data and explore headlines for trends (legnth and words).

Overview: The goal of this projet was to write a program to read and explore the headlines of the Washington Post. I noticed prior that the washington post linked their twitter posts to actual content published in their newspaper. Additionally, the twitter arm of the Washington Post, like most newspapers, highlights and shares content that they think users would find interesting. I wanted to analyze what type of stories the Washington Post posted on their twitter to engange with users.
